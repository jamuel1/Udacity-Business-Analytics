# Udacity-Business-Analytics

Technologies Used: Excel, SQL, Tableau

This is my work for the Udacity Business Analytics Nanodegree Program - (https://www.udacity.com/course/business-analytics-nanodegree--nd098)

//

In this program I was exposed to the the world of data from the perspective of a business analyst. From asking critical questions, to drawing key data to communicate insights to my audience, I was able to draw interesting conclusions from a variety of datasets.

Project 1: Analyzed NYSE Data with Excel - Built a working dashboard to analyze data from over 500 NYSE listed companies as well as a forecast model based on 3 possible scenarios. Using the drop down menu on the Forecast Scenarios tab, you're able to filter & see the P&L forecast the 5th & 6th year for any company you'd like. \\ Dataset Used- NYSE Historical Financial Data from Kaggle (https://www.kaggle.com/dgawlik/nyse)

Project 2: Learned to create and run queries for a digital Music Store database with SQL - drafting and answering questions of interest, and offering suggestions to help optimize business performance. For example, I determined the store's most purchased genres as well and broke down the performance's of the 3 sales agents. From this, I understood that the store should try to offer more Rock music as that genre has the most purchases. Additionally, it was good for the managers to see the performance of each sales agent during their time there.\\ Dataset Used - Chinook Database - Udacity & Github

Project 3: Built visualizations using U.S. Census data in Tableau to identify patterns and trends amongst the US population in 2015. Using Tableau, I analyzed the breakdown of the top 10 states with the highest median rate of self-employment, and found out which counties they resided in. I also determined the average transportation time was lowest in Alaska. By using the dropdown menus near the map, you can select a specific state to focus highlight in the dashboard. \\ Dataset Used: US Census Demographic Data 2015 (https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/muonneutrino/us-census-demographic-data)

P3: Insight 3: What is the breakdown of transportation preferences for each state? Did this play into the average commute time for the given state?
