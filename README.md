# Udacity-Business-Analytics

Technologies Used: Excel, SQL, Tableau

This is my work for the Udacity Business Analytics Nanodegree Program - (https://www.udacity.com/course/business-analytics-nanodegree--nd098)


In this program I was exposed to the the world of data from a business analyst's perspective. From questioning, drawing, and communicating insights, I was able to draw interesting conclusions from datasets.

Project 1: Analyzed NYSE Data with Excel - Built a working dashboard to analyze data from over 500 NYSE listed companies as well as a forecast model for AAL based on 3 possible scenarios.

Project 2: Learned to create and run queries for a digital Music Store database with SQL - drafting and answering questions to help optimize business performance. For example, I determined the store's most purchased genres as well as the breakdown of performance between the 3 sales agents.

Project 3: Built visualizations using U.S. Census data in Tableau to identify patterns and trends amongst the US population. Using Tableau, I analyzed the breakdown of the top 10 states with the highest median rate of self-employment, and found out which counties they resided in. I also determined the average transportation time was lowest in Alaska.

Feel free to check out the individual projects and message me thoughts!

Thanks for reading.
